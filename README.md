## World-AQI-Tracker

### Introduction
<p>Air pollution can be incredibly harmful to human and animal health, and is caused by a number of factors, both natural and artificial.Air pollution is measured using the Air Quality Index (AQI) on a scale from 0-500. The higher the level, the greater the health risk. AQI values under 50 means little to no risk, but values above 300 means the air is hazardous to everyone.</p>

The Air Quality index looks at a few different pollutants:

  - Ground-level ozone
  - Particulates
  - Carbon monoxide
  - Sulphur dioxide
  - Nitrogen dioxide
